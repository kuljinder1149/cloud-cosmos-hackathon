##Project Overview

Cloud Cosmos Assistant is a lightweight AI-powered web application built with Next.js that provides an interactive chat interface.
It enables users to communicate with an intelligent assistant directly in the browser, featuring a clean, responsive UI and modular architecture.


---
##Problem Statement

Many AI-based chat tools are heavy, require backend setup, or lack an intuitive interface.
Our project addresses this by offering a serverless, cloud-native conversational assistant built entirely with modern web technologies, deployable on any platform with minimal configuration.
It focuses on simplicity, accessibility, and real-time interactivity.


---

##Solution Summary

We built a Next.js AI Assistant web app that delivers smooth, chat-based interaction using a simple API endpoint.
Users can send prompts, receive dynamic responses, and view conversation history within a beautifully designed interface.
The app leverages Next.js serverless routes for backend logic and modular UI components for maintainability.

 ##Technical Architecture

Flow:

User â†’ Chat UI (Next.js Frontend)
     â†’ API Route (/api/chat)
     â†’ LLM API (e.g., OpenAI)
     â†’ Response rendered in UI

Frontend (React + Tailwind) sends user message â†’ /api/chat

Serverless route calls AI model â†’ returns response

Message displayed in real-time within assistant UI
